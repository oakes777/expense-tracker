# expense-tracker
Track personal expenses by category and date.
This project will use maps and compound data structures which are the two topics I chose to review the most from the list of available topics in week 2 of SDEV301.
The data structure of this class will consist of an outer map (key 1) (expense category eg. "Entertainment", "Food") and an inner map where dates are keys and values are lists of expenses for each date.
This Java class will function to track daily expenses by category and will be able to generate monthly reports.
If time allows I may add a budget tracking feature which will function to warn the user if they exceed a preset budget.
